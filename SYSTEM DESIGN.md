These are used to create reliable and maintainable and scalable software code. 

1. Single Responsibility - Every single thing - class, method, function should only serve a single puprpose.
2. Open and Closed Principle - Any new functionality should be added without changing the existing code - like components should be added or removed accordingly.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle - Should allow to use interfaces as a "IS A" relationship. This helps to scale the application up.
4. Interface segregration Principle - The art of maintaining completely independant interfaces to reduce dependancy - reduce coupling and make it completely modular.
5. Dependancy Inversion Principle - Adding Abstraction to our code - high level modules should not impact our low level modules unless we want it to.
