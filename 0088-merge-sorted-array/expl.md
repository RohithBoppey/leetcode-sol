- idea is using 3 pointers and to insert the nums2 entries from behind in nums1
- so seen = nums1[m - 1], to = nums1[m + n - 1], and r = nums2[n - 1]
- now we are modifiying seen and to pointers to match and insert the r values
- if nums1[seen] value is more than r, that means it occurs in the nums1 itself somewhere on the right, to nums1[to] = nums1[seen], seen --;
- if nums[seen] < r, that means the r value can occur at at the end of the array, so nums1[to] = nums2[r] and r--;
- there might be a case where the seen might be 0, but remaining elements in the array i.e. meaning should be inserted at the end, so just use the to pointer and r pointer to insert it in the nums1
- ex: `nums1 = [3,5,7,0,0,0,0], nums2=[1,2,4,6]`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        // using pointers for tracking positions and insertion
        int seen = m - 1; // last known pointer in the nums 1
        int r = n - 1; // last max value in the nums 2
        int to = m + n - 1; // which posititon to insert starting from the end

        // this loop can run until either of the pointer is null
        // if r pointer is null, all elements are inserted into the main array
        // if r is not null, that means there are some elements in the nums2 which are less than the least element in nums1 i.e. should be inserted at the start
        while(seen >= 0 && r >= 0){
            if(nums1[seen] < nums2[r]){
                // should be inserted at the end
                nums1[to] = nums2[r];
                r--;
            }else{
                // nums1[seen] >= nums2[r]
                // fill the value in the nums1 itself
                nums1[to] = nums1[seen];
                seen--; 
            }
            to--;
        }

        // now there might be remaining elements in the r
        while(r >= 0){
            // fill the nums1 with to
            nums1[to] = nums2[r];
            r--;
            to--;
        }
    }
};
