since given there is only number that follows this, we can simply use moores algo
that is if an element exists k times there should exist other number for k times only, that way last one number would be left, that is our required number
but for that for n > 3, there is a small thing to notice, no matter the length, the max numbers could only be 2 (image)

so using this logic, we can have 2 counts and translate the same, but making sure that those 2 elements are not equal thats it and finally verify their counts
