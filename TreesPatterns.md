Contains all the important patterns for trees. Helps during revision. 


𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝟭: Tree BFS – Level Order Traversal

Level-by-level exploration using a queue. Great for anything that needs to scan trees layer by layer.

- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
- Binary Tree Right Side View
- Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row
- Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝟮: Tree DFS – Recursive Preorder Traversal

Visit root first, then left/right subtrees. Use for constructing trees, or when order matters.-

- Same Tree
- Symmetric Tree
- Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
- Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
- Invert Binary Tree
- Binary Tree Paths
- Smallest String Starting From Leaf

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝟯: Tree DFS – Recursive Inorder Traversal

Left-root-right, ideal for BSTs (sorted order). Use for validation, finding elements, or iterators.-

- Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
- Validate Binary Search Tree
- Binary Search Tree Iterator
- Kth Smallest Element in a BST
- Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
- Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝟰: Tree DFS – Recursive Postorder Traversal

Left-right-root. Best for problems needing info from children before parents, like depths or sums-

- Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
- Balanced Binary Tree
- Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
- Binary Tree Postorder Traversal
- House Robber III
- Find Leaves of Binary Tree
- Diameter of Binary Tree
- All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree
- Delete Nodes And Return Forest
- Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝟱: Tree – Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) Finding

Finding the lowest shared ancestor for two nodes. Core for questions on ancestry, permissions, or access.

- Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST
- Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝟲: Tree – Serialization and Deserialization
Converting trees to strings/arrays and back. Essential for transfer, cloning, or checking subtrees.

- Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
- Subtree of Another Tree
- Find Duplicate Subtrees
